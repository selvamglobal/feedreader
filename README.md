# Testing using Jasmine

A Udacity FEND project

This project demonstrates browser based testing using [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/).

## Steps to run

* Open `index.html` in the browser of your choice.
* It may take some time to completely load as additional network requests are made.
* Once loaded, test results should be displayed at the bottom of the page.
* As this is a demonstration of Jasmine, Jasmine should report: <em>8 specs, 0 failures</em>
* Click the icon on the far left of the green header to select a different feed.
